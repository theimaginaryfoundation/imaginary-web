# Brand & Web Roadmap

Tracking follow-ups to deepen the experience around WhatIff.chat and the Imaginary Foundation platform.

---

## High-Priority (This Week)
- **Export PNG fallbacks** for `assets/og-image.svg` and `assets/favicon.svg` for platforms that ignore SVG previews.
- **Integrate wordmark** into the nav: swap text brand for `assets/wordmark.svg` (with accessible text alternative).
- **Hero interaction polish:** Add gentle scroll-trigger reveals (respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`) to emphasize continuity storytelling.
- **Form success state:** Create a confirmation page or inline message for Formspree submissions; wire up redirect.

## Near-Term Enhancements
- **Visual companions:** Design memory “rings”/glyphs for AI co-presence (per brand kit Section 12); prototype with subtle animation.
- **Case study / receipts section:** Add a lower-page module explaining boundary protocols, receipts, and how teams audit continuity.
- **Testimonials sweep:** Collect 2–3 short quotes (human + companion user) and render with card pattern.
- **Accessibility audit:** Run full Lighthouse / axe checks and log fixes (tab order, heading hierarchy, ARIA usage).

## Asset Production
- **Wordmark variants:** Dark/light SVG + PNG; sized for social headers and docs.
- **Social toolkit:** Landscape + square promo graphics highlighting key taglines.
- **Favicon sizes:** Export 32×32 and 180×180 PNG icons; update `<link>` tags to include them.
- **Slide template:** Create a minimal deck background using gradient/glass system for investor + partner narratives.

## Future R&D
- **Light theme exploration:** Prototype parchment/indigo inversion for daylight use (see brand kit notes).
- **Sound cues:** Draft sonic logo + state-change chimes (A♭ minor palette).
- **Haptic language:** Document vibration patterns for mobile companion app (two-beat confirm, single pulse boundaries).
- **Governance surface:** Sketch accountability dashboard with timeline receipts and boundary versioning.

## Ops / Documentation
- Keep brand kit and roadmap updated after each release.
- Create a changelog section in README once public beta approaches.
- Start a Figma library mirroring these tokens for cross-team collaboration.
